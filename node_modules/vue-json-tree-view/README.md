## Demo and Blogpost

You can check out the [demo](https://jsfiddle.net/arvidkahl/kwo6vk9d/11/) on JSFiddle and read the Blogpost called [Building a JSON Tree View Component in Vue.js from Scratch in Six Steps](https://devblog.digimondo.io/building-a-json-tree-view-component-in-vue-js-from-scratch-in-six-steps-ce0c05c2fdd8#.dkwh4jo2m) that lead to the creation of this library.

##  Installation

Install the plugin with npm:
```shell
npm install --save vue-json-tree-view
```

Then, in your Application JavaScript, add:
```javascript
import TreeView from "vue-json-tree-view"
Vue.use(TreeView)
```

Done.

## Usage

Put the `tree-view` element into your  HTML where you want the Tree View to appear.
```html
<div>
  <tree-view :data="jsonSource" :options="{maxDepth: 3}"></tree-view>
</div>
```

## Props

#### `data`

The JSON to be displayed. Expects a valid JSON object.

#### `options`

The defaults are:
```
{
  maxDepth: 4,
  rootObjectKey: "root"
}
```
- maxDepth: The maximum number of levels of the JSON Tree that should be expanded by default. Expects an Integer from 0 to Infinity.
- rootObjectKey: the name of the Root Object, will default to `root`

## Custom Styling

All leaves will have their type indicated as a CSS class, like `tree-view-item-value-string`. Supported types: String, Number, Function, Boolean and Null Values.

## Notes

Enjoy.
